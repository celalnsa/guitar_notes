歌词：
I don't wanna be your hero 
I don't wanna be a big man 
Just wanna fight with everyone else 
Your masquerade 
I don't wanna be a part of your parade 
Everyone deserves a chance to 
Walk with everyone else 
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around 
And maybe buy me some new strings 
And her a night out on the weekends 
And we can whisper things 
Secrets from our American dreams 
Baby needs some protection 
But I'm a kid like everyone else 
So let me go 
I don't wanna be your hero 
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight like everyone else 
So let me go 
I don't wanna be your hero 
I don't wanna be a big man 
Just wanna fight with everyone else 
Your masquerade 
i don't wanna be a part of your parade 
Everyone deserves a chance to 
Walk with everyone else
