A             Em  
I see green  I see red         
A            C#  
I see blue  I see black           
A              E  
I see coffee on the table            
C#m             F#m  
And our black and white photo       
D               E  
And over the green mountain         
F#m            A7  
I can see all these rainbow          
D               E  
Lets sing a song in red        
C#m             F#m  
Lets sing a song in blue
        D                 E          A  A7  
Lets sing a song with colours in u.....
          D               E  
Lets sing a song in black
        C#m             C6  
Lets sing a song in blue
       Bm          C#m  
Without the rainbow
       D             E7       A  
Id still sing a song with u.....
