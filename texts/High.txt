INTRO

G - G - G - G

VERSE

 G
Beautiful dawn
 Em7sus4
Lights up the shore for me, there is
 Em                Em7
Nothing else in the world
 A
I’d rather wake up and see with you
 G
Beautiful dawn
 Em7sus4
I’m just chasing time again
 Em                      Em7
Thought I would die a lonely man
 A
In endless night.

CHORUS
           Cadd9   D
But now I’m high
       Em7                Cadd9
running wild among all the stars above
  Cadd9     D
Sometimes
     Em7                    Cadd9
It’s hard to believe you remember me.

VERSE

 G
Beautiful dawn
 Em7sus4
Melts with the stars again
         Em                      Em7
Do you remember the day when my journey began?
 A
Will you remember the end of time?
 G
Beautiful dawn
 Em7sus4
You’re just blowing my mind again
 Em                     Em7
Thought I was born to endless night
 A
Until you shine.

CHORUS
           Cadd9   D
But now I’m high
       Em7                Cadd9
running wild among all the stars above
  Cadd9     D
Sometimes
     Em7                    Cadd9
It’s hard to believe you remember me.

BRIDGE

 Em
Will you be my shoulder
 C
When I’m grey and older?
 A7
Promise me tomorrow
  C
Starts with you, getting . . .

CHORUS

High

running wild among all the stars above
  Cadd9     D
Sometimes
     Em7                    Cadd9
It’s hard to believe you remember me.
 Cadd9   D
High
       Em7                Cadd9
running wild among all the stars above
  Cadd9     D
Sometimes
     Em7                    Cadd9
It’s hard to believe you remember me.
