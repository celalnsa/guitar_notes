Capo 1

intro: F

F
Please don't see just a girl caught up in dreams and fantasies
F
Please see me reaching out for someone I can see
         Em                              F
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
           Em                                   F
Best laid plans sometimes it's just a one night stand
         Em                              F
I'll be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
               G            G
So let's get drunk on our tears and

F              C                           F
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
               C                             F
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
                Em
Searching for meaning
            D                         Dm           G
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

F
Who are we? Just a spec of dust within the galaxy
F
Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality
           Em                                   F
Don't you dare let all those memories bring you sorrow
   Em                         F
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
          Em                               F
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
               G             G
Where we're dancing in our tears and

F              C                           F
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
               C                             F
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
                Em
We're searching for meaning
            D                         Dm           G
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

F                           C
I thought I saw you out there crying
F                          C
I thought I heard you call my name
F                          C
I thought I saw you out there crying
          G
But just the same

F              C                           F
And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
               C                             F
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
                Em
Searching for meaning
            D                         Dm           G
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
         D                         Dm       F   G
Are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
