Intro:  D  G  A  G

D             G                            A     G
  Where is the moment when we need it the most
D                   G                      A   G
  You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Bm                    A                    G
  They tell me your blue sky’s faded to grey
                  D               Em
The tell me your passion’s gone away
                              A  G  A
And I don’t need no carrying on

D               G                      A  G
  Stand in the line just ahead of the law
D                   G                        A  G
  You’re faking a smile with the coffee you go
Bm                  A                   G
  You tell me your life’s been way off line
                   D           Em
You’re falling to pieces everytime
                             A
And I don’t need no carrying on


Chorus:
                     D
Cause you had a bad day
                   G
You’re taking one down
                Em                    A
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
                    D
You say you don’t know
                   G
You tell me don’t lie
                Em                    A
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
               Bm
You had a bad day
                  A
The camera don’t lie
                    G                         D
You’re ing back down and you really don’t mind

And I don’t need no carrying on

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
         Bb
And the whole thing it turns out wrong
     F
You might not make it back and you know
                Bb
That you could be well oh that strong
              A
Well I’m not wrong

D                G                           A
So where is the passion when you need it the most
