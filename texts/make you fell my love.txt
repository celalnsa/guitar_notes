 When the rain is blowing in your face,

 and there is no one there to dry your tears,

 Fm                               C 

 i could hold you for a million years,

 F               G6              C 

 To make you feel my love.


副歌扫弦自己发挥也可以

 　　Am                                         Em (Em 、G)切句的时候连续扫两下
I know you haven't make your mind up yet,

 F                                 Em 
 i would never do you wrong.

 F                                             (G6 、Em、Am) 
 I've know it from the moment that we met，

 　　F                                 G 
 No doubt in my mind where you belong... 停一会



C                               Em7 

 I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue,


 Bm（Fsus4也可）                       Fmaj7/E 

 I'd go crawling down the avenue,


 Fm                 C 

 Go to the ends of the earth for you,


 F         G6         C 
 to make you feel my love 


 F         G6         C 
 to make you feel my love ....
