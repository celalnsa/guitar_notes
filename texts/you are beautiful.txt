1 My life is brilliant.
             C
1            My life is brilliant.
2 She smiled at me on the subway.
          G
1         My love is pure.
2 She was with another man.
        Am7
1       I saw an angel.
2 But I won't lose no sleep on that,
         F9
1        Of that I'm sure.
2 'Cause I've got a plan.

   (F9          G)
356 You're beautiful.
    C
356 You're beautiful.
   (F9          G)
356 You're beautiful, it's true.
        (F9           G)      ((C       G)    Am7)
35 I saw your face          in a crowded place,
            (F9   G)          ((C       G)         Am7) (Am7                 F9)                  (G  (C G))  Am7
6 There must be an angel with a smile on her face,       When she thought up that I should be with you.
   Am7           (F9             G)
35          And I don't know what to do,
6   But it's time to face    the truth,
   Am7            (F9     G)        C
35     'Cause I'll never be with you.
6             I'll never be with you.

G  Am7 F9
               C
4 Yeah, she caught my eye,
        G
4 As we walked on by.
            Am7
4 She could see from my face that I was,
  F9
4     F**king high,
        C                     G
4 And I don't think that I'll see her again,
      Am7                               Am7
4 But we shared a moment that will last till the end.
