[Verse] (Em, C, G, D)
Em       C                       G
How many times do I have to tell you
                D                       Em

              C           G          D                  Em
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every move
            C                G
Youre my downfall, youre my muse
             D                        Em
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
               C            G        D            Am
I cant stop singing, its ringing, in my head for you

[Pre-Chorus Change]
Am            G
Cards on the table
       D             Amadd9
Were both showing hearts
Am          G               D
Risking it all, though its hard

[Chorus]
                  Em   C      G   D
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    D
And you give me all, all of you, oh
